### :zap: Zscaler Certificate Fixer

This tool automatically configures your development environment to work seamlessly behind the NCS Zscaler proxy. It fetches the required Zscaler CA certificates, creates a unified trust store, and configures all major tools (`git`, `gcloud`, `pip`, `npm`, `curl`, etc.) to use it.

This solves the common "certificate validation" and "untrusted SSL certificate" errors.

#### **Installation (macOS / Linux)**

Run the following command in your terminal (`zsh` or `bash`):

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withriley/engineer-enablement/main/tools/zscaler.sh -o /tmp/zscaler.sh && zsh /tmp/zscaler.sh
```

#### **Installation (Windows)**

Run the following command in an **Administrator PowerShell** session:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; $scriptPath = Join-Path $env:TEMP "install_zscaler_windows.ps1"; Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withriley/engineer-enablement/main/tools/install_zscaler_windows.ps1?_=$(Get-Date](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withriley/engineer-enablement/main/tools/install_zscaler_windows.ps1?_=$(Get-Date) -UFormat %s)" -OutFile $scriptPath; & $scriptPath
```

### :sparkles: Mise Environment Setup

This script automates the complete installation and configuration of `mise`, our standard tool for managing different versions of command-line tools like `terraform`, `go`, `node`, `python`, and more.

**Prerequisite:** You must run the **Zscaler Certificate Fixer** script first.

#### **Installation (macOS / Linux)**

Run the following command in your terminal (`zsh` or `bash`):

```bash
curl -sSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withriley/engineer-enablement/main/tools/install_mise.sh?_=$(date +%s)" -o /tmp/install_mise.sh && zsh /tmp/install_mise.sh
```
